# UBC-stack-BOT
Discord bot that facilitates UBC's degree navigation!

What we wanna add here:
1) What the project is about - the problem it identifies, how it offers to solve it
2) How people who come here can learn / use this, or see what is good in this project. An outline of what has been done competently, and how they can see evidence for that.
3) What could be done in the future to improve the project further.
