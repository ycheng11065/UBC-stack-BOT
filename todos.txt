Doing now: 
- reaction is very slow <- add / remove only buttons that are not there
In task:
) create functional version of this that can be used as reference to testing the functionality
 Problems to fix:
 - seems like I need to press reaction twice to jump to the same page
 - wait time is not clear (I don't know when I can press the reactions)

) remove unneeded static variables / introduce static variables and check if functionality is still maintained
1) reorganize the file structure so that it reflects the ui / backside split
2) reorganize the classes in an accordingly fashion
3) debug the code so that it runs faster and without bug
4) learn how to use buttons and employ them instead of reactions
